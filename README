OVERVIEW

Helix® was developed to be an open-source content management system for
front-end programmers. The goal has always been to create a system that puts no
barriers between the content and the markup. The designer has full access to
all HTML and CSS in its raw state — no proprietary methods or tricks to learn.

The secondary goal of Helix® is to provide an easy plugin structure to allow it
to be extended and adapted easily to any needs. No hacking. No workarounds. Just
plugins that do exactly what they're supposed to do.

Finally, Helix® is designed to be out of the way. It's designed to be as thin as
possible so developers can just pick it up and run with it.
